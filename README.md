# Basic_Function_CV2
* Computer Vision is a field dedicated to analyzing images and videos using computational techniques. These methods are employed across various applications, ranging from medical imaging to facial recognition.

## Significance:
 * Computer vision assists in understanding and interpreting the content present in images and videos, allowing a computer to "see" and "comprehend" its surroundings
 
## Basic Image Properties:
* Distinct image properties are used for their analysis and understanding. These properties include color, shape, and texture.
## Computer Vision Techniques:
* 1. **Image Masking and Color Tracking:** Techniques for color tracking and obscuring portions of an image.
  2. **Image Resizing and Geometric Transformation:** To alter the size and shape of images.
  3. **Image Thresholding:** Convert images to purely black and white colors.
  4. **Morphological Transformation:** Change the image shape using mathematical operations.
  5. **Image Filtering:** Use filters to refine images and eliminate noise.
  6. **Edge Detection:** Employ specific techniques to detect edges within images.
  7. **Feature Detection in Images:** Using various algorithms.
  8. **Sift Approach and Feature Matching:** Techniques for matching features across different images.
